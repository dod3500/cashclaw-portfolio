# 🚀 Portable AI USB

> **Run powerful AI coding agents from any computer — no installation required.**  
> Plug in. Launch. Code. Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## 📦 What's Inside

This is a fully portable, zero-footprint AI coding environment that runs directly from a USB drive (or any folder). It bundles everything — Node.js runtime, AI engine, and a web dashboard — so you never install anything on the host computer.

### Features
- 🤖 **5 AI Providers** — OpenRouter (200+ models), Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, Ollama (offline)
- 🌐 **Web Dashboard** — ChatGPT-style interface with agent mode, tool execution, and thinking visualization
- 🔧 **Coding Agent** — Creates files, runs commands, searches code, reads files — autonomously
- 🔒 **Zero Footprint** — Nothing touches the host PC. All data stays on the USB
- 🔄 **Cross-Platform Settings** — Configure on Windows, plug into Linux — it just works
- ⚡ **Limitless Mode** — Full autonomous execution with no confirmations

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Windows
```
1. Download/clone this repo to a USB drive or folder
2. Double-click:  Windows\Setup_First_Time.bat
3. Follow the prompts (picks provider, model, API key)
4. Done! Use Start_AI.bat or Open_Dashboard.bat anytime
```

### Linux
```bash
cd Portable_AI_USB/Linux
chmod +x *.sh
./setup_first_time.sh
```

### macOS
```bash
cd Portable_AI_USB/Mac
bash setup.sh
```

> **First-time setup requires internet** to download Node.js (~25MB) and the AI engine (~5MB).  
> After that, everything runs offline (except API calls to your AI provider).

## 🛠 Available Scripts

| Script | What it does |

| **Setup_First_Time** | Downloads Node.js, installs AI engine. Run once. |
| **Start_AI** | Configure provider → select model → launch CLI agent. Use `--quick` for instant limitless mode. |
| **Open_Dashboard** | Starts the web dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` |
| **Change_Model_or_Provider** | Menu to change model, change API key, or full reset config |
| **Uninstall** | Removes engine (bin/) and optionally all data (settings + chats) |

### Command-Line Flags (Start_AI)
```
--quick     Skip menus, launch in Limitless mode instantly
--offline   Skip engine update check
```

## 🖥 Web Dashboard

The web dashboard provides a ChatGPT-style interface with agent superpowers:

- **Chat Mode** — Simple conversation with streaming responses
- **Agent Mode** — AI can create files, run commands, search code
- **Thinking Cards** — See the AI's reasoning process (expand/collapse with ▼)
- **Tool Execution** — Visual cards showing what the agent is doing
- **Normal Mode** — Asks for approval before writing files or running commands
- **Limitless Mode** — Full autonomous execution

Launch it:
```
Windows:  Open_Dashboard.bat
Linux:    ./open_dashboard.sh
macOS:    bash open_dashboard.sh
```
Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

## 🔄 Cross-Platform: Configure Once, Use Everywhere

The `data/` folder is shared across all platforms. This means:

1. ✅ Set up your API key on **Windows**
2. ✅ Plug the USB into a **Linux** machine — your settings are already there
3. ✅ Move to a **Mac** — same thing, zero reconfiguration

Each platform only needs its own `bin/` folder (created by running setup on that platform).

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Zero Footprint** — No files are written outside the USB/project folder
- **Portable Data** — `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and `XDG_DATA_HOME` are all redirected to `data/`
- **API Key Masking** — Keys are masked in all display output (e.g., `sk-abc1****xyz9`)
- **Approval System** — In Normal mode, write operations require your explicit OK
- **No Telemetry** — Nothing is sent anywhere except your chosen AI provider

---

## 📋 System Requirements

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| **Windows** | Windows 10+ (nothing else needed — Node.js is bundled) |
| **Linux** | `curl` (pre-installed on most distros). Git/Python recommended. |
| **macOS** | `curl` (pre-installed). For git: `xcode-select --install` |

**Disk Space:** ~150 MB for Node.js + engine per platform

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Node.js not found" | Run `Setup_First_Time` first |
| "Port 3000 in use" | Dashboard is already running, or another app uses port 3000 |
| API key rejected | Double-check your key at the provider's website |
| "No internet" | Setup requires internet. After setup, only API calls need internet. |
| Models not loading | OpenRouter API may be slow. Try again, or enter a model name manually. |
| Data leaking to `~/.openclaude` | Make sure you launch via `start_ai.sh` / `Start_AI.bat` — they set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to keep data portable. |
